# GraphQLDM
GraphQLDM is a powerful command-line tool for seamless interaction with GraphQL APIs. It offers easy querying, mutation execution, and data manipulation, empowering developers to efficiently manage and explore GraphQL data through simple commands.

## Installation

You can install GraphQLDM using pip:

```bash
pip install graphqldm
```

## Setup

After installing, make sure to set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable to include the path to your GraphQLDM package. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file(e.b, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`):

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/GraphQLDM:$PYTHONPATH
```

Replace `/path/to/GraphQLDM` with the actual path to your GraphQLDM package.

This ensures that Python can find the necessary modules and packages when running the gqldm command.
